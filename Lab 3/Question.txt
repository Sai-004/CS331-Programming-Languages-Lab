House Building Simulation Problem Using Multithreading and Barrier Synchronization in Java
Consider a scenario where a team of workers is assigned to build a house. Building a house can be divided into distinct stages. 
It is necessary that all workers need to complete the current stage before moving onto the next one. 
Your task is to simulate this process of building house using concept of multithreading and barrier synchronization.
Total no. of stages are 5. Digging, Building a foundation, Building walls, Building roofs, Finishing.


Requirements:
1. Allow user to input no. of worker threads.
2.Implement barrier synchronization to ensure that all worker complete current stage to proceeding to the next stage
3.Print message indicating complete of stage after completing the current stage with time.
4.A worker thread takes random time to complete a stage (between 500 to 1000 milliseconds).
5.A worker thread must print the time when it starts to work on current stage and time he took to complete current stage.
6.Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.


Testing:
- Ensure barrier synchronization prevents workers from proceeding to the next stage until all workers complete the current stage.
- Observe timestamps for the start and completion of each stage.
- Verify correct functioning with user-specified number of worker threads.


Note: You can use following libraries to print and format time.
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

Allotted Question:

Write a Java program that simulates a library system with multiple reading rooms, bookshelves and readers. 
The library has a fixed number of reading rooms where readers can enter and a fixed number of bookshelves where they can borrow books.
Readers arrive at the library and attempt to enter through one of the reading rooms. 
Once inside, they proceed to borrow books from one of the available bookshelves. 
Bookshelves  have a maximum capacity and readers must wait if all shelves are occupied. 
Each bookshelf can serve one reader at a time and multiple readers cannot access the same shelf simultaneously. 
Use Java threads to model readers entering the library and borrowing books.


Requirements:

1. Create a ‘Library’ class that manages the reading rooms and bookshelves.
2. Implement a ‘ReadingRoom’ class that represents a reading room. Readers should enter through one of the reading rooms.
3. Implement a ‘Bookshelf’ class that represents a bookshelf. Each shelf can serve one reader at a time.
4. Implement a ‘Reader’ class that represents a reader. Readers enter through a reading room and then proceed to borrow books.
5. The library should have a maximum number of readers it can serve concurrently, and readers must wait if all bookshelves are occupied.
6. Use threads to run multiple instances of reading rooms, bookshelves and readers concurrently.
7. The program should continue running indefinitely.
8. Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms to manage the flow of readers and avoid race conditions.
